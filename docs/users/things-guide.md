Avatars are representations of a user in a world, which you can control and view in first-person mode to see their perspective. They are XRPackages created from <a href="https://vrm.dev/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VRM files</a>.

You can **wear** _any_ XRPackage to make it your avatar &mdash; it can be anything from a sword to a person, packaged into an XRPackage.
