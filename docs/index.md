There's a huge problem, which is, The Metaverse is already here -- it's just locked away in silos. <a href="https://webaverse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Webaverse</a> solves this by plugging into existing standards and communities in order to bootstrap the metaverse.

## Developers

The Webaverse ecosystem is built on existing open web standards like WebXR, IPFS, and Ethereum.
