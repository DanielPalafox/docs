Webaverse is an open source virtual world built on principles of enabling true digital ownership, an open economy, and interoperability. There's several parts:

- Tools to create and monetize content
- Custom avatars + multiplayer + VR support
- Discovery of amazing experiences across the 3D web

The plan is to combine the best parts the community likes about video games + interoperable open standards + web tech into unique digital assets ([NFTs](./webaverse/items)) that get released on a periodic basis.



## Getting Started 




Use [SILK](./webaverse/silk) to mint [NFTs](./webaverse/nfts), just by messaging with a [Discord Bot](./webaverse/discord-bot).

Or that you can create your very own [Avatars](./webaverse/avatars) and build on [Parcels](./webaverse/parcels) that are a part of everchanging [Seasons](./webaverse/seasons).

## Market 

Since Webaverse is built with NFTs, any creation in Webaverse can be bought, sold, and traded on open and decentralized marketplaces like OpenSea. 

Check out [our market guides](./market/silk-guide) for more information on how you can [buy](./market/nfts-guide), [sell](./market/nfts-guide), and [trade](./market/trade-guide) in Webaverse.

## Create 

Creators of a variety of backgrounds can build for Webaverse: 3D modelers, JavaScript 3D website programmers, and designers. 

Check out [our creator guides](./create/index.md) for more information on getting started with building.
