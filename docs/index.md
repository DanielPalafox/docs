Webaverse is an open source virtual world built on principles of enabling true digital ownership, an open economy, and interoperability. There's several parts:

- Tools to create and monetize content
- Custom avatars + multiplayer + VR support
- Discovery of amazing experiences across the Internet

The virtual world is organized around one main street, like a web page that goes forwards and backwards instead of up and down. It's also a metaphor for a blockchain, in which The Street is the ever expanding chain connecting the blocks that contributors help shape throughout time.

The Street is a curated quality experience, coordinated in artistic direction per season theme. Along The Street are various areas of land that users can own and control called [parcels](/docs/webaverse/parcels), which can be linked to full experiences within or outside the platform.



The current plan is to combine the best parts the community likes about video games + the web into unique digital assets ([NFTs](./webaverse/items)) that get released periodically during every season.

## Getting Started 

![](/img/ethbot.jpg)

The easiest way to get started is by joining the Webaverse Discord server and using the bot. Minting NFTs is free, but you'll need [SILK](./silk) in order to use the tools.

- Join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/R5wqYhvv53) and introduce yourself
  - Type `.name -h` in the Discord to learn how to setup your username
  - Login to the main website by typing `.login`
  - Ask for some [SILK](/docs/webaverse/silk) to create items

**Set your avatar**

The easiest way to make your own custom VRM avatar is with [VRoid Studio](https://vroid.com/en/studio/). Once you've created your avatar with VRoid Studio, you can [import into Webaverse](/docs/create/import-vroid).

> Note: Be sure to double check the optimization settings on the export page to get the best performance from your avatar!
