## ❓ Overview

The future of human-computer interaction and application design is spatial. The market for Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality devices continues to progress at a steady rate. As the hardware improves the software ecosystem will need new creators and content to take advantage of the new medium. Currently the market is comprised of a handful of large companies who hold the final decision on what types of content and technology is allowed on their platform. This entirely new medium of applications and experiences risks being owned and controlled by these monopolies.

Webaverse solves this problem with existing standards and open technologies. Users of the Webaverse platform are in full control and have real ownership of their applications and experiences. Webaverse applications are available in every web browser, and on every headset.

### What is Webaverse?

The Webaverse is a term that describes an ecosystem of technologies that enable the use of spatial applications and objects powered by WebXR.

### Supported Asset Types

The Webaverse supports many different asset types to enable creators to easily bring their original content directly into the Webaverse ecosystem.

Currently the following file formats are supported:

* GLTF Models (*.gltf, *.glb)
* VRM 3D Avatars (.vrm)
* MagicaVoxel Models (.vox)
* WebXR sites and applications
* Unity HTML5 Exports (Experimental)

### Import Existing Creations

Any content creation platform that can export to one of these formats can be easily packaged and brought into the Webaverse. To get you started we've written some guides that document the process of exporting and packaging content from some popular creation platforms

#### I want to package my creations from...
#### _Coming soon!_
* [~~Tiltbrush~~](index.md)
* [~~SculptVR~~](index.md)
* [~~Oculus Medium~~](index.md)
* [~~Google Blocks/Poly~~](index.md)
* [~~Quill~~](index.md)
* [~~SculptVR~~](index.md)
* [~~Supercraft~~](index.md)
* [~~Anyland~~](index.md)

In addition to support traditional 3D models, Webaverse can also package and use WebXR sites written in Three, Babylon, or any other WebXR compatible javascript framework. For more information on creating an aug from an existing WebXR site, see the [`Create Your First Aug`](creating-an-aug.md) guide.

## 🦸 Developers

The Webaverse ecosystem is built on existing web standards like WebXR, IPFS, and Ethereum.
