## What is WebXR?
WebXR is the open standard for running Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality experiences within a web browser. By unifying multiple technologies into a single truth, WebXR makes it easier to create immersive 3D cross-reality (XR) experiences. Such standards facilitate 3D rendering onto hardware for imaging virtual environments or graphical imagery.

WebXR Device APIs provide standardized interfaces with XR devices that recognize VR/AR-compatible devices, translate movement from input devices and sensors into controllable vectors, and render 3D scenes at appropriate frame rate to facilitate smooth interactions. 

The WebXR feature set addresses challenges in maintaining data processing with low latency and high precision. The API is currently supported by Chrome and Firefox.
