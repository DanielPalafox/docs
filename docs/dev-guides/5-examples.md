Before diving into creating your own XRPackages, it can be useful to see some examples and play around with the code!

This page aims to serve as a reference for community and official examples of WebXR and similar content to help get started!

## Glitch

<a href="https://glitch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glitch</a> is a simple tool to create, edit, and share web apps.

It's a simple editor in your browser where you can run code that people share with you and 'remix' (like a GitHub fork) them in your own account.

We've <a href="https://glitch.com/~xrpackage-creator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">created some examples on Glitch</a> for you to play around with -- feel free to remix them and turn them into your own amazing ideas!

## awesome-xrpackage

We have a curated list of XRPackages from the community and developers of XRPackage. You can find these <a href="https://github.com/webaverse/awesome-xrpackage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">at GitHub</a>.

We'll be regularly updating this -- if you have a contribution you want listed, we'd love a pull request!

## Project files

Some of the guides on this site use example projects compressed into a ZIP file. You can download them below:

- <a href="https://github.com/MLH-Fellowship/threejs-demo/archive/master.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Example WebXR (three.js) project</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/MLH-Fellowship/aframe-demo/archive/master.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Example WebXR (A-Frame) project</a>

## Templates

We and the community have created some simple templates you can clone and start working off to make your own creations:

- See <a href="https://github.com/Zetaphor/webxr-template" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">webxr-template on GitHub</a> for a barebones WebXR scene with tracked controllers.
- See <a href="https://github.com/webaverse/xrpackage-threejs-template" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">xrpackage-threejs-template on GitHub</a> as an example of a full XRPackage repository, complete with `manifest.json` and a THREE.js WebXR scene!
