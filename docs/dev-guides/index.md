We're thrilled to have you on board with making the Webaverse a more exciting place for users around the world!

The Webaverse runs on applications that you can write, package and distribute. These packages are called XRPackages (XRPKs).

We've made it as easy as possible to get started! A few points to start with:

- There's no Webaverse SDK! Just make your app using one of the many supported asset types (see below) and quickly package it using our CLI or our simple drag-and-drop UI at <a href="https://xrpackage.org/inspect.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">xrpackage.org</a>.
- Once you've made your apps, it's really easy to distribute your packages to decentralized systems -- meaning you don't need your own server or hosting service to get your creations out to the world!

Please check out our [`XRPackage Overview`](./1-xrpackage-overview.md) to begin your developer journey into the Webaverse.

## Supported Asset Types

The Webaverse supports many different asset types to enable creators to easily bring their original content directly into the Webaverse ecosystem.

Currently the following file formats are supported:

- GLTF Models (`.gltf`, `.glb`)
- VRM 3D Avatars (`.vrm`)
- MagicaVoxel Models (`.vox`)
- WebXR sites and applications (THREE.js, A-Frame, Babylon, etc.)
- Unity HTML5 Exports (Experimental)

## Import Existing Creations

Webaverse can package existing WebXR sites written using THREE.js, A-Frame, Babylon, or any other WebXR compatible JavaScript framework!

For more information on packaging an XRPK from an existing WebXR site, see the [`Create Your First XRPackage`](./2-creating-an-xrpk.md) guide to get started.

In addition, Webaverse supports traditional 3D models. Any content creation platform that can export to one of the following formats can be easily packaged and brought into the Webaverse.

To get you started we've written some guides that document the process of exporting and packaging content from some popular creation platforms
