We're thrilled to have you on board with making the Webaverse a more exciting place for users around the world!

The Webaverse runs on applications that you can write, package and distribute. These packages are called XRPackages (XRPKs).

We've made it as easy as possible to get started! Please check out our [`XRPackage Overview`](./1-xrpackage-overview.md) to begin your developer journey into the Webaverse.

### Supported Asset Types

The Webaverse supports many different asset types to enable creators to easily bring their original content directly into the Webaverse ecosystem.

Currently the following file formats are supported:

- GLTF Models (_.gltf, _.glb)
- VRM 3D Avatars (.vrm)
- MagicaVoxel Models (.vox)
- WebXR sites and applications
- Unity HTML5 Exports (Experimental)

### Import Existing Creations

Any content creation platform that can export to one of these formats can be easily packaged and brought into the Webaverse. To get you started we've written some guides that document the process of exporting and packaging content from some popular creation platforms

In addition to supporting traditional 3D models, Webaverse can also package WebXR sites written in Three, Babylon, or any other WebXR compatible JavaScript framework!

For more information on packaging an aug from an existing WebXR site, see the [`Create Your First Aug`](./2-creating-an-aug.md) guide to get started.
