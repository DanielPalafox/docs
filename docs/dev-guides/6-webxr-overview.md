title: WebXR Overview
---

WebXR is the open standard for running Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality experiences within a web browser. By unifying multiple technologies into a single truth, WebXR makes it easier to create immersive 3D cross-reality (XR) experiences. Such standards facilitate 3D rendering onto hardware for imaging virtual environments or graphical imagery.

The WebXR feature set addresses challenges in maintaining data processing with low latency and high precision. [WebXR Device APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API) is JavaScript-based and provides standardized interfaces with XR devices that recognize VR/AR-compatible devices, translate movement from input devices and sensors into controllable vectors, and render 3D scenes at appropriate frame rate to facilitate smooth interactions. The API is currently supported by Chrome and Firefox.

The WebXR Device API provides easy spatial object interactions by adopting the "point and click" approach. Input sources are defined by pointer rays to designate input device locations to fire events in the virtual space.

## Technologies

WebXR is combined with the following frameworks and tools:

- [three.js](https://threejs.org/): cross-browser JS library API for creating GPU-accelerated 3D computer graphics
- [WebGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API): JS web graphics library API for rendering high-performance 2D and 3D graphics
