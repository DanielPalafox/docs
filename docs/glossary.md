The Webaverse ecosystem, VR, and XRPackage have all sorts of terminology that can be daunting for newcomers.

This glossary aims to provide a simple, easy-to-follow explanation of any terms you might come across whilst using, or developing for, the Webaverse ecosystem.

### Webaverse

The Webaverse is a universe of spatial apps that can run everywhere. Apps can be created by anyone, including you!

### XRPackage

XRPackages are virtual things you can drop into a 3D world. These objects can interact with each other in the Webaverse.

### Skybox

In 3D, a _skybox_ is a virtual cube with a texture (e.g. a sky, or a park, or mountains) that is the bounds of a virtual world. It essentially allows you to provide a background environment that the user sees all around them.

### Tracked Controllers

This means that your apps or scenes can track your VR controllers, to move in relation to them in real-time.
