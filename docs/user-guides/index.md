## What hardware/headset do I need?

While XRPackage does support desktop mode as a first class feature, the primary focus of Webaverse is on mixed reality devices; a virtual reality Head-Mounted Display (HMD) is recommended to enjoy the full experience and capabilities of the platform.

- on Windows, a SteamVR compatible headset
- on Oculus Quest, you can load any WebXR site with the built-in browser
