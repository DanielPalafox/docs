title: Finding Applications (XRPackages)
---

The Webaverse revolves around "applications" packaged into "XRPackages" (XRPKs).

This guide explains how you can find XRPKs that other users have created and published.

## Browsing for XRPackages

You can easily browse, download, inspect, and modify XRPackages via <a href="https://xrpackage.org/browse.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the XRPackage site</a> &mdash; all through your browser!

When the page loads, you will see a collection of packages:

> ![XRPackage Browse page](/img/xrpackage-browse.png)

You can download these packages with the appropriate buttons, or note the IDs so you can install and use them yourself!

Clicking on one of the images will bring you to the 'inspect' page where you can freely play around with the object:

### IPFS, Ethereum, and the Registry

You might wonder what the groups "IPFS" and "Ethereum" at the top of the page mean. These describe the different publishing modes for XRPackages.

- The Webaverse Package Registry is a database/collection of all the XRPKs that have been published to the IPFS (see below).

- <a href="https://ipfs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IPFS</a> is the InterPlanetary File System &mdash; it's an open source (just like the Webaverse!), _decentralized_ technology that distributes files using 'peer-to-peer' networking.

  This removes the reliance on a central server (which would be owned by one individual/organisation), instead sharing files between many different computers (_peers_), making it more reliable for others to fetch the content.

- <a href="https://ethereum.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ethereum</a> is another decentralized open source system but it is based on a _blockchain_.

  A blockchain is a global, shared database where data is stored as _blocks_ which are _cryptographically_ linked together. This means each block has a permanent reference to its position in the database &mdash; once data has been added to the blockchain, it is near-impossible to remove or alter.

  This makes it ideal for creators who want to permanently record their package as belonging to themselves, opening up possibilities for sharing and selling securely.
