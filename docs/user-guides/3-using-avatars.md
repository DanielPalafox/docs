title: Using Avatars
---

Avatars are just XRPackages created from <a href="https://vrm.dev/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VRM files</a> (built on top of glTF binary files). Your avatar is what you can control and view in first-person mode to see their perspective.

Similar to [using XRPackages](./2-using-xrpackages.md), you can select pre-published Avatars from the <a href="https://xrpackage.org/edit.html">XRPackage edit page</a>.

The largest public hub of VRM avatars can be found at <a href="https://hub.vroid.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hub.vroid.com</a>, which can be used to find and upload avatars for your use.

You can **wear** _any_ XRPackage to make it your avatar &mdash; it can be anything from a sword to a person, packaged into an XRPackage.

Just like in the previous guide, selecting 'Packages' will let you choose an XRPK to _wear_:

Clicking 'Wear' will set your avatar to be this XRPackage.

## View modes

Once you have an avatar, it's useful to experiment with the different view modes! At the top-right of the screen you will see the following control panel:

> ![XRPackage View Modes](/img/xrpackage-edit-view-modes.png)

These toggle between the different view modes of the world, listed here in-order from left-to-right:

1. **Camera Tool**: drag around the world to move to different areas, and zoom in/out by scrolling up/down. Your arrow keys will also let you move the view around!
2. **First Person**: view the world from your avatar's view! You can use your keyboard's W, A, S, D keys to move around the world, and move your mouse to look around it!
3. **Third Person**: view the world as a 3rd person, looking at your avatar. The controls are the same as First Person mode.
4. **Isometric Mode**: view the world in isometric view, eliminating any shape distortions created by perspective.
5. **Select Tool**: select XRPackages in the world and manipulate them by altering their position, scale, and many more!
