title: Creating for the Webaverse
---

If you've read the previous sections of the User Guides, it should be clear that the Webaverse simply revolves around "applications" packaged into "XRPackages" (XRPKs).

You can just drop the XRPackages into a world, and what you make is only limited by your imagination.

**We've made it incredibly easy to get started developing for the Webaverse.**

If you already have some 3D or VR content, it's likely you'll be able to immediately package and distribute this with little effort.

If you want to create something from scratch, our developer guides will introduce you to making your own WebXR application in a few simple steps, and provide you with a simple template &mdash; ready for you to build on and make your ideas come to life in the Webaverse!

Please give our [developer guides](../dev-guides/index.md) a read for more information on how to get started! We're really excited to see what you create!

Remember, you can always find our friendly Webaverse community on <a href="https://discord.gg/MQNUGgB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a>.
