Now that you [know how to find XRPackages](./1-finding-xrpackages.md), this guide discusses how you can use them!

The <a href="https://xrpackage.org/edit.html">XRPackage edit page</a> lets you add XRPackages from the Registry to your current world:

> ![XRPackage Edit Page](/img/xrpackage-edit-home.png)

It will load with a sandbox world which you can modify as you like.

## Creating worlds

The 'World' button at the bottom left will let you browse and select any existing worlds, for you to explore and modify. You can also create your own world with the 'New world' button!

## Loading XRPackages

Once you're in a world, there are two ways to load packages: from the registry, or uploading your own XRPackage `.wbn` file.

- The 'Add package' button at the bottom lets you upload your own package, to import into the world
- The 'Packages' button lets you browse through all the packages available, and add them to the world with one click:

## Saving worlds

When you're happy with your world, you can save it using the 'Save' button at the bottom left:

The unique URL for each world will let you come back to it at any time to edit, or share with others!
