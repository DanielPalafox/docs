### Prerequisites:

### WebUI

Minting NFTs in Webaverse is done by simply dragging and dropping files into the [Webaverse Mint Page](https://webaverse.com/mint).

You will be taken into a 3D world preview to double check the asset looks good before minting.

### Discord

Drag and drop a file into a server that contains the [Discord bot](https://webaverse.com/discordbot) and type `.mint` as the message. If you want to mint more than 1 edition, type `.mint 5` or however many in the message field.
