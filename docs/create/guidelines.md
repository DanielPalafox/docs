title: Creator Guide
---

We're building a technological foundation and open source brand for the decentralized metaverse. To create a movement we'll need the help of artists, developers, writers, connectors, and promoters.


## Get Started

- Be a creator with experience using an existing toolset.
- Join the [Webaverse Discord](https://discord.gg/R5wqYhvv53) and select a role in the `#get-started` channel.

## Schedule

There's a weekly call to sync up and go over current initiatives. The time of this call is to be determined based on our timezones and vote with our first contributors.

## FAQ

**What's in it for me?**

There's a system to measure and reward value during the contribution cycle. You can earn SILK which can also be used to claim exclusive NFTs available to contributors only. Your ideas and creations can make it into the next season as NFTs. If you choose to sell them, this can mean lifetime royalties with NFT splits once implemented.

**How do I fit in?**

The best way is to introduce yourself and share something you made! If you're an artist share your work. If you can program, drop a link to your project or Github. If you're unsure, perhaps mention what drew you into the project. We'll find ways to connect your talents and interests to something that can make a meaningful impact.

**Do I really have value to offer?**

Of course, there's many ways to contribute. One light but important task would be to take notes during meetings. If you have a way with words you could help create lore for items and the world as a scientist by interacting with a Discord bot. We have a [Wikia](https://webaverse.fandom.com/wiki/Webaverse_Wiki) setup that could use some help.

During community calls we go over what we're currently working on and how people can get involved. If you have questions please don't hesitate to ask in any channel on the discord server.

## Artists

The brand guide for Season 0 is coming out soon. We're using Github to keep track of what's being worked on here: https://github.com/webaverse/app/projects

**2D artists**

There's endless work for making illustrations. Concept art of new ideas is always needed as well as art that synthesizes our characters in different contexts such as battling a monster, crossing a bridge, or chilling at home.

**Musicians**

Audio is one of the most important aspects of game dev. People don't even need to turn on the N64 to remember Ocarina of Time, they can just listen to the OST and be teleported back. We're in need of looping background music and in-game sound effects.


### 3D Technical limits

These are soft limits that we're setting in order to have a smooth experience for as many devices and internet connections as possible. These limitations may change in the future depending on feedback we get.

#### Avatars

Keep in mind that the platform being targetted is the web browser. <5k triangles and 1 texture is optimal.

**Triangles:** 10k is considered high.

**Materials:** No more than 3 materials.

**Textures:** No larger than 2k texture size.

**Size:** Try not to be as big as a skyscraper.

**Total file size:** 5mb is fine

#### Wearables, Pets, and Vehicles

Everything from swords, guns, hats, pets, mounts, hoverboads and hovercrafts falls under this category.

**Triangles:** More than 5k is considered high.

**Materials:** 1 is great, more than 3 is high.

**Textures:** No larger than 2k texture size.

**Size:** Use your best judgement with a [VRM sample](https://github.com/madjin/vrm-samples)

**Total file size:** 5mb is okay

#### Neighborhoods

Each neighborhood should follow the limits below and be respectful in design to not clog The Street.

**Triangles:** No more than 200k triangles.
  
**Materials:** No more than 8 materials.

**Textures:** No larger than 4k texture size.

**Size:** No larger than 100m wide. (depth & height can be larger)

**Total file size:** No larger than 20mb.
