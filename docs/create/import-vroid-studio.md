This guide explains how you can export your avatar from <a href="https://vroid.com/en/studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VRoid Studio</a> to bring it into Webaverse.

The easiest way to do this is to export your avatar into <a href="https://vrm.dev/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VRM format</a>.

## 1. Export your VRoid Studio avatar as a VRM file

To export your model, click the "Camera/Exporter" tab at the top of the program:

Click the "Export" button in the panel on the left:

You can tweak any mesh, material, or bone reduction settings you want in the panel on the right.

Click "Export":

You can now fill in any final details in the "VRM Settings" popup, and click "OK" to export the avatar as a `.vrm` file.

After clicking "OK", you will need to choose a location on your computer to save the new .VRM exported file to.

## 2. Mint your VRM file as an NFT

See [How To Mint NFTs](./mint.md) for how to mint the `.vrm` file you exported above.
