This guide will walk you step-by-step to setting up your Webaverse profile. 

You will set up your own avatar, name, and log into the Webaverse world for the first time!

## 1. Drag and drop avatar into Discord
> ![Dropping file into Discord](/img/avatar-1.png)

## 2. Type `.mint 1` in the Discord comment
> ![Typing mint 1 command in Discord comment](/img/avatar-2.png)

The Discord Bot should respond with the id of the token and file hash:

## 3. Run `.avatar` + token id
The token id will be what the Discord Bot responded with in step #2, in this case it was 15.

If you type `.status`, you should now see your name and avatar set in your profile.

**Note:** If you do not receive a DM, make sure that you allow direct messages from server members. Go to the settings in Discord -> `Privacy & Safety` -> make sure `Allow direct messages from server members` is checked green.
