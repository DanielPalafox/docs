The Webaverse is built by having a bunch of spatial NFTs together in the same shared space. Anything from [Avatars](./avatars), [Parcels](./parcels), Images, and 3D items can be NFTs.

## FAQ

### How Can I Mint NFTs?

You can mint NFTs simply by dragging and dropping a file into Discord. If you want a step-by-step guide on how mint NFTs, check out [this guide](../create/mint).

### Technically, what are they?

NFT stands stands for Non-Fungible Token. The term and the NFTs in Webaverse are based off the Ethereum [ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) token standard.

Non-fungible means that it is not interchangable, so while you can trade NFTs, you'll never have an exactly equivalent trade. NFTs are not interchangable, unlike a fungible token like [Grease](./grease).
