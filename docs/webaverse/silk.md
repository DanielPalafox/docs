SILK is a token that is used in Webaverse primarily to mint [NFTs](./nfts). It's main purpose is to invite others into the network and prevent spam so together we can build a web of trust as the Webaverse scales.

If you're a Discord server admin that wants to distribute SILK amongst your community to use the [NFT Discord Bot](https://webaverse.com/discordbot) then ping us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/3byWubumSa) or [email us](hello@webaverse.com).

## FAQ

### Why the name SILK?

The issue for bridging worlds together isn't so much a tech related problem, its a matter of incentives. The name SILK is inspired by the ancient Silk Road, which connected the world thousands of years ago through cross-country trade routes. We aim to unlock the value loops to connect virtual worlds together into something greater than the sum of their parts.

### Technically, what is SILK?

SILK is an ERC-20 token based on the Ethereum [ERC-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) Token Standard that runs on the Webaverse sidechain. It takes 10 SILK to mint something on Webaverse. SILK has no initial monetary value.

### How do I get SILK?

SILK is currently invite only, meaning you need to either know somebody who has some or you can drop into the Webaverse [Discord](discord.gg/VyneJY7) server and ask. There is no exchange to buy SILK from. We are working on creative ways to obtain SILK through the bot and from the virtual world.
