Interested in designing a world in Webaverse? You came to the right spot. There are currently several methods to building in the virtual world. Give us feedback in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/3byWubumSa), new processes are constantly being developed.


## Blender

Models in Webaverse are made with glTF binary files (.glb), which Blender 2.8+ has an export option for. You can also use the Webaverse [blender plugin](https://github.com/webaverse/blender-plugin) to export directly from Blender to the minting page.

If your scene has lightmap bakes, you can use [hubs-blender-exporter](https://github.com/MozillaReality/hubs-blender-exporter) and configure your nodes in the shader editor to export with a lightmap in the .glb file.

## In-game Editing

Users can drag and drop files into the [Webaverse app](https://app.webaverse.com) window to temporarily spawn them into the world. If you're in a multiplayer realm (`.realm [1-5]` typed in Discord) then the spawned objects will have persistence.


There's also an in-game builder you can use with `Z` `X` and `C` keys to switch between creating a wall, floor, and ramp.

## Editaverse

Editaverse consiststs of experimental Webaverse workflow integrations with open source 3D creation tools, such as [Mozilla Spoke](https://hubs.mozilla.com/spoke) and [Blocks Editor](https://github.com/danielesteban/blocks-editor).
