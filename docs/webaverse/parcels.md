title: Parcels 
---

Parcels represent an area of the Webaverse world that you can own and build anything on. Creators can build full virtual experiences and select an area that gets hyperlinked bidirectionally to The Street. Parcels are fundamentally [NFTs](./nfts), which means that each parcel is unique and there will not be another exactly like it. 

Currently Webaverse is more interested in collaborating with artists to sell content and experiences rather than empty land. Designing something cool helps secure a spot on The Street, even if its concept art. If you're a 2D or 3D artist interested in bringing your idea to life come chat with us on the Discord: https://discord.gg/3byWubumSa



More information about how the parcel system works is coming soon.
