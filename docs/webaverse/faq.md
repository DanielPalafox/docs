# Frequently Asked Questions



#### What is SILK?

As explained [here](https://docs.webaverse.com/docs/webaverse/silk), SILK is a fungible ERC-20 utility token that is primarily used as a spam filter when minting NFTs in Webaverse.


#### How do I get LAND?

LAND currently isn't for sale at the moment, we will announce when it is. However, there is also a [creator program](https://utc9pqk8vl1.typeform.com/to/rZp09YYu) for artists of all backgrounds to bring their ideas into season 1 and earn a slice of the virtual world.


#### How do I buy stuff?

You can purchase native digital items for Webaverse from Opensea. Support for 3rd party NFTs will be added in the future.

- Assets on Ethereum mainnet: https://opensea.io/collection/asset
- Assets on the Matic blockchain: https://opensea.io/collection/asset-v3


#### Where are assets hosted?

Assets are hosted on S3 and [IPFS](https://ipfs.io), the Interplanetary File System. In the future we plan to integrate Filecoin and ARweave for long-term decentralized storage.


#### Does this work in VR?

Yes! Through the WebXR API we are able to deliver a VR experience through the web browser. VR support is still pretty experimental, we will give an ETA when we feel confident about a stable release.


#### Do I need a crypto wallet to participate?

Nope! You will be automatically given an Ethereum address when joining a discord server with the [bot](/docs/webaverse/discord-bot) or signing into the website. Transactions are free on the sidechain. At any time you can setup a wallet and transfer NFTs and fungible tokens to it.
