title: How To Buy And Sell NFTs 
---

This is a quick guide on how to buy and sell NFTs. It's really only three commands: 
- `.sell` + NFT id
- `.store` + @user
- `.buy` + sale id

If you want to learn more about the Discord Bot, you can [see more here](../webaverse/discord-bot).

## 1. `.sell` + NFT id + how much FLUX you want to sell for
